    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish known for its layers of wide, flat pasta sheets alternating with rich fillings. Typically, these layers include a robust meat sauce, often made with ground beef or sausage cooked with onions, garlic, tomatoes, and herbs like basil and oregano. This sauce is commonly known as a ragù or Bolognese sauce.

        In addition to the meat sauce, lasagna includes a creamy cheese mixture, frequently made with ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses. Some recipes also incorporate béchamel sauce, a white sauce made from butter, flour, and milk, adding an extra layer of creaminess.
